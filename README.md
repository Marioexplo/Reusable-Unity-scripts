# Reusable-Unity-scripts
Here I leave some Unity scripts I think can be useful. I'm only at the beginning of my journey with Unity and C# and, until now, the only games I made were experiments, so I haven't published anything, yet.
Anyway, before focusing on the next game I have in mind, I wanted to make some scripts I can reuse in the future. I'm sure I haven't created anything new but I can't find any reason why I shouldn't share my code here.
